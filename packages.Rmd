title: "Packages / splverse"
description: |
  A set of R packages developed to help solve problems that frequently occur when performing infectious disease surveillance.
  The splverse has been created by the Sykdomspulsen team (specialized in infectious disease surveillance), who use it every 
  day to streamline and improve their pipelines and deliverables. The splverse has been used and improved throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, 
  forming the basis of all of Sykdomspulsen's products.

```{r, layout="l-body", out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("packages/hex_dependencies.png")
```

## Installation and Use

```{r, layout="l-body", out.width = "20%", preview=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("packages/splverse.png")
```

If you want to install the dev versions (or access packages that haven't been released on CRAN), run `usethis::edit_r_profile()` to edit your `.Rprofile`. 

Then write in:

```
options(
  repos = structure(c(
    SPLVERSE  = "https://docs.sykdomspulsen.no/drat/",
    CRAN      = "https://cran.rstudio.com"
  ))
)
```

Save the file and restart R.

You can now install [splverse](https://docs.sykdomspulsen.no/packages) packages from our [drat repository](https://docs.sykdomspulsen.no/drat).
