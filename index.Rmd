### What IS Sykdomspulsen

Sykdomspulsen is a unique project that processes new data (e.g. covid-19 cases) shortly after it is available. Complex statistical analyses are automatically run for all locations in Norway, producing reports and alerting various stakeholders.

This provides the health authorities the ability to make proactive strategic decisions with the most up-to-date information.


### Analyses Delivered in _near real time_



«Data» is not useful by itself. Data must be cleaned, analysed, and the results delivered to stakeholders.

An effective outbreak response requires this in near real-time.

Sykdomspulsen's goal is to achieve this.
