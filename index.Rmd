«Data» is not useful by itself. Data must be cleaned, analysed, and the results delivered to stakeholders.

An effective outbreak response requires this in near real-time.

Sykdomspulsen's goal is to achieve this.

### Quick stats

- We receive data from more than 15 data sources every day
- 2 000 000 000+ rows of data and results (1TB)
- 1000+ database tables
- 500 000+ analyses per day
- 500+ automatic reports per day

### Sykdomspulsen core

Sykdomspulsen Core is the free and open-source backbone of Sykdomspulsen.

Sykdomspulsen Core is a standalone R package, which means it is easy for other teams to build up their own surveillance infrastructure based on Sykdomspulsen Core.

### splverse

splverse is a number of R packages that have been developed by the Sykdomspulsen team to help with infectious diseases surveillance.
