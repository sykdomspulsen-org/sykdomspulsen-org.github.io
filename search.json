The aim of this course is to enable the student to\nidentify which methods are required for their study, allowing the\nstudent to identify their needs for subsequent methods courses,\nself-learning, or external help.\n\n\n\nLongitudinal\nAnalysis for Surveillance teaches students to run “normal\nregressions” in situations where the data structure would ordinarily\nprohibit you from running regression models. These situations mostly\npertain to clusters of correlated data.\nWhen dealing with longitudinal data, there are two kinds of analyses\nthat can be performed:\n“Time series” analyses generally deal with one variable. The aim is\nto then predict the future only using the previous observations. A\ncommon example would be to predict tomorrow’s temperature, using today’s\nand yesterday’s temperature as exposures. We will not be\nfocusing on these kinds of analyses in this course.\n“Regression analyses” are very similar to ordinary regressions that\nyou have been working with for many years. The only difference is that\nthey have more advanced data structures that your current methods cannot\nhandle. For example, if you want to see how the number of tuberculosis\npatients (outcome) is affected by the number of immigrants to Norway\n(exposure) over a 20 year period, then the number of patients in each\nyear might be associated with each other, which might break assumptions\nof the regression models that you normally use (independent residuals).\nTo account for the advanced structure of the data (correlation between\ndifferent years) we will use more advanced regression techniques.\nThis will be the focus of the course.\n\n\n\n",
